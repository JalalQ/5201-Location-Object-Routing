# Introduction

For the **LAB1-1-routing.html** file, I used JavaScript location object to give the impression of a three page website, by making use of the URL Query.

For the **LAB1-2-Fave3.html** file, the following sequence of steps take place.
- user enters the names and phone numbers of their favourite three contacts and clicks "Save My Fave Three".
- the form disappears and a list of the three names appears.
- when the form is submitted, a Friend constructor function is called to take the input from the form to create three Friend objects (with 2 properties) and add them to the faveThree array.
